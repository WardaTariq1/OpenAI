Flutter OpenAI and REST API Integration
This Flutter application demonstrates integration with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user input and fetches data from a sample REST API to display a list of items. It features a simple UI with navigation and follows Flutter best practices.

Features

OpenAI API Integration:
Users can input a text prompt and receive AI-generated responses.
Responses are displayed below the input field.

REST API Integration:
Fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
Displays a scrollable list of post titles.

User Interface:
A navigation bar with two tabs:
OpenAI Chat: Input prompt and view AI-generated responses.
Posts List: View a list of posts from the REST API.

State Management:
Uses Provider for managing application state.

Error Handling:
Handles API call failures gracefully, displaying error messages.
